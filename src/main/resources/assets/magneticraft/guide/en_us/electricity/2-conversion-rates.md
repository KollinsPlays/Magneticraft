# Conversion Rates

*NOTE:*
- Watts denote rate of energy flow  (energy per tick)
- Joules denote an amount of energy (energy stored in batteries)

*Watts*
- 1 J = 1 RF
- 1 J = 0.25 EU
- 1 J = 1 FE (forge energy)
- 1 Watt = 1 J/t

*Steam*
- 1 J = 0.5mB of Steam
- 1mB of Water = 10mB of Steam

Radius of the sun (why not?): 695.700 km
