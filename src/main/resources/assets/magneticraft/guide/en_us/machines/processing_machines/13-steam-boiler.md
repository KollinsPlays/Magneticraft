# Big Steam Boiler

Like the steam boiler block, it produces steam from heat and water. This 
multiblock produces up to 600 mB of steam per tick, being 30 times faster than a single steam boiler.

You can input heat by the bottom and water at the sides and top.
It only auto-extracts steam in the top-center spot of the multiblock, 
but you can actively extract the steam from any side and the top.

This structure is a [multiblock](../../3-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 4, 3* (x, y, z).

Materials needed:
- 1 x Big Steam Boiler Blueprint
- 8 x Machine Block
