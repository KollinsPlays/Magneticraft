# Solar Tower

This multiblock creates heat based on how many [Solar Mirrors](6.1-solar-mirror.md) are linked to it.
The heat can be sent to a [Boiler] and converted to steam for a [Steam engine](2-steam-engine.md).

The structure has a connector on the bottom that outputs heat.

The max production of the tower is 2400 Watts of heat per tick, equivalent to 1200Mb of steam.
Every solar mirror linked to the tower generates 16 Watts in the form of heat.

This structure is a [multiblock](../../3-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 3, 3* (x, y, z).

Materials needed:
- 1 x Solar Tower Blueprint
- 16 x Machine Blocks
- 2 x Copper Coil Machine Blocks
- 7 x Corrugated Iron Machine BLock
