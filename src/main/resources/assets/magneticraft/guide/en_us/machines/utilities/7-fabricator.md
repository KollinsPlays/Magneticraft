# Fabricator

Works like an automatic crafting table, but cannot be automated.
You can set the crafting pattern by placing items on the grid or with JEI clicking on the plus button.

The main feature of the fabricator is its ability to grab items from near inventories, 
if you place a chest next to the fabricator, it will use the materials from the chest to craft.
