# Big Combustion Chamber

If the Combustion Chamber is not enough for your energy needs, the Big Combustion Chamber is here for you!

This multiblock burns any kind of solid fuel and even liquid fuels, just not both at the same time. 
It is 10 times faster than the combustion chamber block in solid fuels, for fluid fuels the energy production 
depends on the fuel value.

If Buildcraft is installed the fuel values for fluids will be obtained from their API, if the mod is not
installed only the fluids of the mod will have fuel values.

The inputs are at the sides marked with a metal block, the 3x3 top side of the multiblock is the heat output.

This structure is a [multiblock](../../3-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 3, 4* (x, y, z).

Materials needed:
- 1 x Big Combustion Chamber Blueprint
- 16 x Brick Blocks
- 2 x Corrugate Iron Machine Block
